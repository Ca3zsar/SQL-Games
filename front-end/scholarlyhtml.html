        <p>
          The following site has the purpose of offering its users a chance to
          practice their skills in the databases course and learn how to write
          SQL queries properly. Another purpose of the application is to boost
          the users' creativity by offering them a chance to create their own
          queries to be solved by other users. Also, it is intended to help
          teachers track their students' progress and organize them in classes
          in order to evaluate them.
        </p>

        <h4 id="product-benefits">1.4.2 Benefits</h4>
        <p>
          The site offers a wide range of exercises for different levels of
          knowledge relating to the databases course. The shop system
          encourages the users to perform as good as possible, so they can
          accumulate more eSQLids. <br />
          Achievements are intended as not only a form of bragging, but also a
          way of noting the most advanced students. <br />
          The grouping of students in classes in order to follow their
          evolution is another benefit of the application, helping teachers
          evaluating their students in an easier way.
        </p>

        <h4 id="product-goals">1.4.3 Goals and objectives</h4>
        <p>
          The main goal of this web application is to help regular users learn
          how to write SQL queries in a much easier way through solving
          exercises that are easier to comprehend than abstract concepts. It
          will also make it much more fun to learn by receiving various
          achievements.

      <h3 id="operating-environment">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Can be used on any device with a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS
        and JavaScript. Media queries allow for a comfortable use on any
        screen resolution (above 400px width).
      </p>

      <h3 id="constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        SQL-Games interface is developed using only vanilla HTML5, CSS3,
        JavaScript without any frameworks or plugins. <br />
        The project backend is written in PHP 8 and is based on MVC
        architecture that will modularize the project in 3 main components :
        Models, Views and Controllers. The MVC structure will make the
        application modular and easier to develop.
      </p>

      <h3 id="documentantion">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        A potential help page or guide for users on the site may be added
        sometime in the future.
      </p>

      <h3 id="dependencies">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        SQL-Games is developed using JavaScript and HTML5, therefore disabling
        the JavaScript or using a browser that does not support HTML5 could
        result in users being unable to use the site. Another factor that can
        alter users experience is using a device with a very low resolution
        screen (under 400px width) because otherwise the text editor would not
        load properly.

      <h2 id="system-features">4. System Features</h2>

      <h3 id="first-feature">4.1 System Feature 1: SQL exercises solving</h3>
      <p>
        Users can solve a wide range of exercises with certain levels of
        difficulty relating to databases by typing the query in the code
        editor on the exercise page. Every exercise will be solved on its own
        individual page. The page contains a section with all the infromation
        about the task and a blank space/code editor for solving the given
        exercise as shown in the <a href="#user-interface-8">3.1 screenshot</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="first-feature-1">4.1.1 Description and Priority</h4>
      <p>
        This feature is of High priority, as it is the main use of this site.
        The requirement section also features a colored bar in its right part with the
        following meaning: if the color is red it means that the user did not
        unlocked the current exercise and therefore they cannot solve it; if the
        color is yellow it means that the user did not succeed in solving the exercise
        or they had not tried the exercise yet ( but they unlocked it previously);
        the green color means that the user succeeded is solving the exercise.
      </p>
      <h4 id="first-feature-2">4.1.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user types the response to the given exercise - the system
          checks if the solution is right using the exercise the especially created
          database and returns a message depending on wether the solution was
          wrong or right.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on how good, how fast or in which manner the task was
          solved, the user can get a corresponding achievement.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the user tries to enter DML / DDL commands they will be notified,
          because this type of commands is forbidden. In case of spamming this kind
          of command, the user will be restricted from the site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="first-feature-3">4.1.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        In case of a wrong answer, invalid input or an error from the
        exercises database the site will notify the user either by an error, if
        there was a mistake in the input or if there was a problem at the exercise database,
        or through coloring the section of the requirement which
        displays if the exercise was solved correctly
      </p>

      <h3 id="second-feature"> 4.2 System Feature 2: Shop</h3>
      <p>
        By giving right solutions to the exercises, users gain an amount of
        local currency - "eSQLids", depending on the difficulty of the task.
        They can use this currency to buy other exercises in the "shop"
        section, where all the other available tasks are filtered by
        difficulty or other criteria.
      </p>
      <h4 id="second-feature-1">4.2.1 Description and Priority</h4>
      <p>
        The priority of this feature is high priority based on the fact that before
        solving an exercise, the user has to first pick one up. This feature
        gives the user a way to choose what task to solve next. After that he
        is sent to the exercise screen.
      </p>

      <h4 id="second-feature-2">4.2.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the user has enough eSQLids and "buys" an exercise - the user is
          redirected to the exercise page
        </li>
        <li>
          the user does not have enough currency to buy an exercise - the
          exercise page can not be accesed by clicking the button, untill the
          user has gained enough to finally unlock it.
        </li>
        <li>
          by clicking on of the "layout" buttons, the user can choose to
          rearrange the way the list of items in the shop looks: an expanded
          or more compact way.
        </li>
        <li>the search bar allows the user to find a specific exercise</li>
        <li>
          the filter options can help the user alter the list of exercises, so
          the most relevant to him/her are shown
        </li>
        <li>
          the color of the button from an exercise section represents the state
          of the exercise : red means that the user cannot afford to buy that exercise,
          yellow means that they can buy it, green means that the exercise is bought and
          can be solved, and transparent with the text "solved" means that the user
          solved the exercise
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="second-feature-3">4.2.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The search bar should access the exercises database and return the
            needed values. The buttons shall change the layout.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Invalid search inputs will return no results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The layout button will resize the content of the page depending on the
            user's prefference ( compact or extended).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The filter button will show only the exercises that satisfy the criteria
            chosen by the user.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The buy button will make the exercise available for a user if they have
            enough eSQLids to buy it.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="third-feature">4.3 System Feature 3: Achievements</h3>

      <p>
        Special achievements are shown on the personal profile page of the
        user. Claiming some of them can even give the user more eSQLids. Some
        of them include being the first to solve a task, solving all the tasks
        of a category.
      </p>

      <h4 id="third-feature-1">4.3.1 Description and Priority</h4>
      <p>
        Low priority, as this feature is only cosmetic or/and to stimulate
        learning. But it is a feature we would strongly like to implements,
        because it will greatly influence the users' experience.
      </p>

      <h4 id="third-feature-2">4.3.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When a user does something remarkable, they gey an achievement,
          shown on personal profile page.
        </li>
        <li>
          The achievements are specific and can be added indefinetely after the
          project finalization.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="third-feature-3">4.3.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        The site should be notified when the user does something that checks
        an achievement condition, so the achievemnt in cause is unlocked on
        his/her profile page.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fourth-feature">4.4 System Feature 4: Profile</h3>
      <p>
        By registering, every user will have their own profile on the site,
        which they can use to solve the given tasks and gain eSQLids to solve
        others.
      </p>

      <h4 id="fourth-feature-1">4.4.1 Description and Priority</h4>
      <p>
        Medium priority, because it is an important safety/security
        requirement, but it is not the main intent of the site. The profile
        is intended to help tracking the progress of an individual and help
        the web application not getting spammed.
      </p>

      <h4 id="fourth-feature-2">4.4.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user registers - the site remembers their account details.
          The user will be needed to enter information such as : their name,
          an email used to confirm their account, and a password. In case of
          wrong input (such as some other text than an email address) the person
          will be notified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logging in with the correct credentials gives the user access to
          their account. In order to log in the individual is required to
          enter the correct email and the corresponding password.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="fourth-feature-3">4.4.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        Introducing the wrong credentials will result in incapability of
        accessing the account features. Registering requires a password and
        login of adequate length. Also some logins may be banned for obscene
        meaning.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fifth-feature">4.5 System Feature 5: Profile Settings</h3>
      <p>
        Every user is able to modify their account information in the profile
        settings section of the website. The Settings section enables users
        to change things like : the email address linked to the account, their name,
        their description and their contact information.
      </p>
      <h4 id="fifth-feature-1">4.5.1 Description and Priority</h4>
      <p>
        Low priority, because it offers the users the possibility to add
        new information about themselves or modify some incorrect information from
        their accounts, but it does not affect the process of solving exercises
        on the application, nor the overall interaction with the website.
      </p>
      <h4 id="fifth-feature-2">4.5.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user enters the settings section and can see the kind of information
          they can change. In order to access that section the person has to be
          connected. If they are not connected an error message will be displayed
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can modify information from their account, such as email address,
          name or birthday. In case of invalid input the user will be notified.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user has to submit all the changes they have made, otherwise all the
          modifications will be discarded.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="fifth-feature-3">4.5.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The user is required to enter valid data, such as a valid
          email address or a valid birthday
        </li>
        <li>
          The user has to enter their current password in order to be able
          to change it, and must type the new password twitce, in order to confirm it
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="sixth-feature">4.6 System Feature 6: Code Editor Syntax Highlighting</h3>
      <p>
        While typing their solution to a specific exercise the users will
        have specific syntax higlighted in order to help them visualize their
        code better.
      </p>
      <h4 id="sixth-feature-1">4.6.1 Description and Priority</h4>
      <p>
        This feature has a medium priority because even though an user will
        be able to write code without the syntax highlighting, this would come
        in handy when the solution gets more extended and they will need some
        way to visualize the code in a better way.
      </p>
      <h4 id="sixth-feature-2">4.6.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the user will type some SQL reserved keywords, they will be colored
          with a different color in the code editor in order to make the exercise solving
          easier for the user.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="sixth-feature-3">4.6.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In order to use the syntax highlighter the user has to enter valid
            SQL keywords, otherwise the words will be considered to be names from
            the tables or other kind of placeholders.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the user wants to use the syntax highlighter they are required to
          enable JavaScript as the editor runs a script that constantly verifies
          the input and highlights it accordingly.
        </li>

      <h3 id="performance">5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        This web application does not have any specific system requirements in order to
        run properly but it would be desirable to use a device able to load
        load the pages properly and not in a slow way so as to the user experience
        not to be sluggish or laggy.
      </p>

      <h3 id="safety">5.2 Safety Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure that every solution is processed and the results are returned in
        a correct way, the application will get updated regularly based on users'
        feedback or bugs discovered by the developers of the application.
        Another aspect that we will take care about is the aquisition of exercises,
        so the shop will be constantly verified and taken care of, so the users
        have the best experience, without any problem of any kind.
      </p>

      <h3 id="security">5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        The user profile should be protected by a login and password system,
        to maintain their privacy and keep their data safe. <br>
        Other security measures that have to be taken are : prevention of SQL-injection
        attacks, blocking the multiple consecutive request coming from a user
        in order to prevent spamming that could slow down the application and
        blocking the users that would try to use queries in the exercises that could
        result in negative effects on the exercise database.
