            <h2>4. System Features</h2>

            <h3>4.1 System Feature 1: SQL exercises solving</h3>
            <p>Users can solve a wide range of exercises relating to databases, by typing the interogation in the blank
                space of the solving page. </p>
            <h4>4.1.1 Description and Priority</h4>
            <p>This feature is of High priority, as it is the main use of this site. </p>
            <h4>4.1.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The user types the response to the given exercise - the system checks if the solution is right using
                    the exercise "student" database and returns a message depending on wether the solution was wrong,
                    right or partially right.</li>
                <li>Depending on how good, how fast or in which manner the task was solved, the user can get a
                    corresponding achievemnt.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4.1.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
            <p>In case of a wrong answer, invalid input or an error from the "student" database the site will notify the
                user with the
                "wrong" banner.</p>

            <h3>4.2 System Feature 2: Shop</h3>
            <p>By giving right solutions to the exercises, users gain an amount of local currency - "sqlids",
                depending on the difficulty of the task. They can use this currency to buy other exercises in the "shop"
                section, where all the other disponible tasks are filtered by difficulty. </p>
            <h4>4.2.1 Description and Priority</h4>
            <p>High priority based on the fact that before solving an exercise, the user has to first pick one up. This
                feature gives the user a way to choose what task to solve next. After that he is sent to the exrcise
                screen. </p>

            <h4>4.2.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>the user has enough sqlids and "buys" an exercise - the user is redirected to the exercise page</li>
                <li>the user does not have enough currency to buy an exercise - the exercise page can not be accesed by
                    clicking the button, untill the user has gained enough to finally unlock it.</li>
                <li>by clicking on of the "layout" buttons, the user can choose to rearrange the way the list of items
                    in the shop looks: an expanded or more compact way.</li>
                <li>the search bar allows the user to find a specific exercise</li>
                <li>the filter options can help the user alter the list of exercises, so the most relevant to him/her
                    are shown</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4.2.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
            <h5>4.2.3.1 ...</h5>
            <p>The search bar should access the exercises database and return the needed values. The buttons shall
                change the layout.</p>
            <h5>4.2.3.2 Response to errors</h5>
            <p>Invalid search inputs will return no results. </p>

            <h3>4.3 System Feature 3: Achievements</h3>

            <p>Special achievemnts are shown on the personal profile page of the user. Claiming some of them can even
                give the user more "sqlids". Some of them include being the first to solve a task, solving all the tasks
                of a category, solving an exercise in a record time.</p>

            <h4>4.3.1 Description and Priority</h4>
            <p>Low priority, as this feature is only cosmetic or/and stimullating for learning. But it is a feature we
                would strongly like to implements, because it will greatly influence the users' experience.</p>

            <h4>4.3.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When a user does something remarcable, he/she gets an achievemnt, shown on personal profile page.
                </li>
                <li>The achievemnts are specific and can be added indefinetely after the project finnalization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4.3.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
            <p>The site should be notified when the user does something that checks an achievement condition, so the
                achievemnt in cause is unlocked on his/her profile page. </p>

            <h3>4.4 System Feature 4: Profile</h3>
            <p>By registering, every user will have their own profile on the site, whic they can use to solve the given
                tasks and gain sqlids to solve others. </p>

            <h4>4.4.1 Description and Priority</h4>
            <p>Medium-High prority, because it is an important safety/security requirement, but it is not the main
                intent of the site.</p>

            <h4>4.4.2 Stimulus/Response</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The user registers - the site remembers his/hers account details.</li>
                <li>Logging in with the correct credentials gives the user acces to his/her account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4.4.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
            <p>Introducing the wrong credentials will result in incapability of accesing the account features.
                Registering requires a password and login of adequate lenght. Also some logins may be banned for obscene
                meaning.</p>

            <h2>5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
            <p>Make the site as fast as possible. Use techniques that require minimum capacity. Some sacrifices for the
                sake of how beautiful the site looks can be made, but in decent quantities.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Safety Requirements</h3>
            <p>No damage to the user can be made using this site. The only necessary safeguard would be some
                restrictions to avoid SQL injections.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
            <p>The user profile should be protected by a login and password system, to maintain their privacy and keep
                their data safe. Some options such as hiding the amount of grossed sqlids, or number of achievemnts
                could be hidden away by this system too.</p>

            <h3>5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>

        </section>

        <section typeof="sa:Acknowledgements????">
            <h2>Other Requirements</h2>
            <h3>1</h3>
            <p>A database for storing user data such as profile information, achievemnts, number of sqlids.</p>
            <h3>2</h3>
            <p>A database for solving the tasks on the site. It should have defined tables and data, giving the users
                the privellege of using data contained in it, to solve the exercises.</p>


            <h3>Appendix A: Glossary</h3>
            <p><i><b>sqlid</b></i> - local currency used for buying new exercises from the shop. Can be earned by
                solving tasks or gaining achievements.</p>

            <figure typeof="sa:image"><img src="resources/first.png"></figure>
            <p> - this symbol means that the exercise has not been solved by anyone, so the user can be the fisrt
                one to do it.</p>
